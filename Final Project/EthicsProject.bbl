    \field{abstract}{%
    While the discussion on generative artificial intelligence, such as
  ChatGPT, is making waves in academia and the popular press, there is a need
  for more insight into the use of ChatGPT among students and the potential
  harmful or beneficial consequences associated with its usage. Using samples
  from two studies, the current research examined the causes and consequences
  of ChatGPT usage among university students. Study 1 developed and validated
  an eight-item scale to measure ChatGPT usage by conducting a survey among
  university students (N = 165). Study 2 used a three-wave time-lagged design
  to collect data from university students (N = 494) to further validate the
  scale and test the study's hypotheses. Study 2 also examined the effects of
  academic workload, academic time pressure, sensitivity to rewards, and
  sensitivity to quality on ChatGPT usage. Study 2 further examined the effects
  of ChatGPT usage on students'levels of procrastination, memory loss, and
  academic performance. Study 1 provided evidence for the validity and
  reliability of the ChatGPT usage scale. Furthermore, study 2 revealed that
  when students faced higher academic workload and time pressure, they were
  more likely to use ChatGPT. In contrast, students who were sensitive to
  rewards were less likely to use ChatGPT. Not surprisingly, use of ChatGPT was
  likely to develop tendencies for procrastination and memory loss and dampen
  the students'academic performance. Finally, academic workload, time pressure,
  and sensitivity to rewards had indirect effects on students'outcomes through
  ChatGPT usage.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The difficulty of ensuring cyber-security is steadily growing as a result
  of the alarming development in computer connectivity and the sizeable number
  of applications associated to computers in recent years. The system also
  requires robust defines against the growing number of cyber threats. As a
  result, a possible role for cyber-security might be performed by developing
  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect inconsistencies and threats in
  computer networks. An effective data-driven intrusion detection system has
  been created with the use of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine
  Learning techniques. This research proposes a novel Binary Grasshopper
  Optimized Twin Support Vector Machine (BGOTSVM) based security model which
  first considers the security features ranking according to their relevance
  before developing an IDS model based on the significant features that have
  been selected. By lowering the feature dimensions, this approach not only
  improves predictive performance for unidentified tests but also lowers the
  model's computational expense. Trials are conducted using four common ML
  techniques to compare the results to those of the current approaches
  (Decision Tree, Random Decision Forest, Random Tree, and Artificial Neural
  Network). The experimental findings of this study confirm that the suggested
  methods may be used as learning-based models for network intrusion detection
  and demonstrate that, when used in the real world, they outperform
  conventional ML techniques.%
