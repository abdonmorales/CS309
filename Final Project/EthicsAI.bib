@inproceedings{Mishra:2023aa,
	abstract = {The difficulty of ensuring cyber-security is steadily growing as a result of the alarming development in computer connectivity and the sizeable number of applications associated to computers in recent years. The system also requires robust defines against the growing number of cyber threats. As a result, a possible role for cyber-security might be performed by developing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect inconsistencies and threats in computer networks. An effective data-driven intrusion detection system has been created with the use of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning techniques. This research proposes a novel Binary Grasshopper Optimized Twin Support Vector Machine (BGOTSVM) based security model which first considers the security features ranking according to their relevance before developing an IDS model based on the significant features that have been selected. By lowering the feature dimensions, this approach not only improves predictive performance for unidentified tests but also lowers the model's computational expense. Trials are conducted using four common ML techniques to compare the results to those of the current approaches (Decision Tree, Random Decision Forest, Random Tree, and Artificial Neural Network). The experimental findings of this study confirm that the suggested methods may be used as learning-based models for network intrusion detection and demonstrate that, when used in the real world, they outperform conventional ML techniques.},

@article{Dhieb:2020aa,
	abstract = {The private insurance sector is recognized as one of the fastest-growing industries. This rapid growth has fueled incredible transformations over the past decade. Nowadays, there exist insurance products for most high-value assets such as vehicles, jewellery, health/life, and homes. Insurance companies are at the forefront in adopting cutting-edge operations, processes, and mathematical models to maximize profit whilst servicing their customers claims. Traditional methods that are exclusively based on human-in-the-loop models are very time-consuming and inaccurate. In this paper, we develop a secure and automated insurance system framework that reduces human interaction, secures the insurance activities, alerts and informs about risky customers, detects fraudulent claims, and reduces monetary loss for the insurance sector. After presenting the blockchain-based framework to enable secure transactions and data sharing among different interacting agents within the insurance network, we propose to employ the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm for the aforementioned insurance services and compare its performances with those of other state-of-the-art algorithms. The obtained results reveal that, when applied to an auto insurance dataset, the XGboost achieves high performance gains compared to other existing learning algorithms. For instance, it reaches 7% higher accuracy compared to decision tree models when detecting fraudulent claims. The obtained results reveal that, when applied to an auto insurance dataset, the XGboost achieves high performance gains compared to other existing learning algorithms. For instance, it reaches 7% higher accuracy compared to decision tree models when detecting fraudulent claims. Furthermore, we propose an online learning solution to automatically deal with real-time updates of the insurance network and we show that it outperforms another online state-of-the-art algorithm. Finally, we combine the developed machine learning modules with the hyperledger fabric composer to implement and emulate the artificial intelligence and blockchain-based framework.},

@article{Perkins:2024aa,
	abstract = {This study investigates the efficacy of six major Generative AI (GenAI) text detectors when confronted with machine-generated content modified to evade detection (n = 805). We compare these detectors to assess their reliability in identifying AI-generated text in educational settings, where they are increasingly used to address academic integrity concerns. Results show significant reductions in detector accuracy (17.4{\%}) when faced with simple techniques to manipulate the AI generated content. The varying performances of GenAI tools and detectors indicate they cannot currently be recommended for determining academic integrity violations due to accuracy limitations and the potential for false accusation which undermines inclusive and fair assessment practices. However, these tools may support learning and academic integrity when used non-punitively. This study aims to guide educators and institutions in the critical implementation of AI text detectors in higher education, highlighting the importance of exploring alternatives to maintain inclusivity in the face of emerging technologies.},

@article{Ardito:aa,
	abstract = {Abstract This chapter presents a critical analysis of generative AI (GenAI) detection tools in higher education assessments. The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of GenAI, particularly in education, necessitates a reevaluation of traditional academic integrity mechanisms. I explore the effectiveness, vulnerabilities, and ethical implications of AI detection tools in the context of preserving academic integrity. My analysis synthesizes insights from various case studies, newspaper articles, and student testimonies to scrutinize the practical and philosophical challenges associated with AI detection. I argue that reliance on detection mechanisms is misaligned with the educational landscape, where AI plays an increasing role. I advocate for a strategic shift toward robust assessment methods and educational policies that embrace GenAI usage while ensuring academic integrity and authenticity in assessments.},

@article{Abbas:2024aa,
	abstract = {While the discussion on generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, is making waves in academia and the popular press, there is a need for more insight into the use of ChatGPT among students and the potential harmful or beneficial consequences associated with its usage. Using samples from two studies, the current research examined the causes and consequences of ChatGPT usage among university students. Study 1 developed and validated an eight-item scale to measure ChatGPT usage by conducting a survey among university students (N = 165). Study 2 used a three-wave time-lagged design to collect data from university students (N = 494) to further validate the scale and test the study's hypotheses. Study 2 also examined the effects of academic workload, academic time pressure, sensitivity to rewards, and sensitivity to quality on ChatGPT usage. Study 2 further examined the  effects of ChatGPT usage on students'levels of procrastination, memory loss, and academic performance. Study 1 provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the ChatGPT usage scale. Furthermore, study 2 revealed that when students faced higher academic workload and time pressure, they were more likely to use ChatGPT. In contrast, students who were sensitive to rewards were less likely to use ChatGPT. Not surprisingly, use of ChatGPT was likely to develop tendencies for procrastination and memory loss and dampen the students'academic performance. Finally, academic workload, time pressure, and sensitivity to rewards had indirect effects on students'outcomes through ChatGPT usage.},
