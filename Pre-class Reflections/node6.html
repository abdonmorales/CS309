Week 7</A>

Part 1:
SCENARIO: You are a data scientist working for a healthcare company developing an AI model to predict the likelihood of patients developing a specific disease based on their medical history and lifestyle data. The company has collected a large dataset from a local hospital, consisting primarily of patients from one region with similar demographic backgrounds and lifestyles.

<P>
At a team meeting, a colleague expresses excitement over the model’s high accuracy when tested on the local hospital data, and the company is eager to deploy the system nationwide. However, another team member raises concerns about the model’s ability to generalize to patients from different regions, cultures, and backgrounds. They argue that since the training data is limited to one demographic group, the model might not perform as well on diverse populations, potentially leading to incorrect predictions or even bias against underrepresented groups. Another concern is that the model might be overfitting the local data, meaning it could perform exceptionally well on the training data but fail when exposed to new, unseen medical history of a patient.

<P>
Write a paragraph reflecting on the ethical implications of deploying this AI model. You may address questions such as:

<UL>
<LI>What might be the source of generalization gap when deploying the model nationwide?
</LI>
<LI>What are the risks of overfitting the model to the training data, and how can they affect the patients' outcomes?
</LI>
<LI>What steps can be taken to avoid overfitting and ensure the model works across diverse patient groups?
</LI>
</UL>
Part 2:
Reflecting on the content of this module (including all videos and reading), write a paragraph (5–10 sentences) that includes one or more of the following:

<UL>
<LI>Insightful questions;
</LI>
<LI>Clarification questions about ambiguities;
</LI>
<LI>Comments about the relation of the content to previous content;
</LI>
<LI>Solutions to problems or exercises posed in the readings or videos;
</LI>
<LI>Critiques;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on what you would like to learn about in more detail;
</LI>
<LI>Possible extensions or related studies;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on the topic's importance; and
</LI>
<LI>Summaries of the most important things you learned.
</LI>
</UL>
Part 2 of this reflection is designed both to encourage you to engage with the videos before Thursday class and also to allow us to incorporate some of your responses into the Thursday class discussions.

<P>
Some of the source of the generalization gap when deploying is the consideration of people from different backgrounds; in which the model may somewhat suffer this gap but this can be addressed with redundant testing via validation sets. Furthermore, we can breakdown the dataset to more pieces in order to address the model's inaccuracy, however, this can lead to more erroneous testing that could make the training dataset useless. Then again, there should be more rigorous testing before releasing this model to the public via quality source control through a small internal beta before moving onto a public beta. Some risks of overfitting the model to the training can lead to larger margin of error when it's is deployed nationwide using real-world data versus testing it using training set data; and model biases. This can lead to more erroneous results for many patients.

<P>
On this module, for me, this is the very first time for to know what machine learning is conceptually; but in the terms of its application, I have seen it before in my day-to-day life via video games, email spam control, and so much more. With these past explanation in the slides and video, it has made it more clearly me the impacts that machine learning has in our lives. Whether it is apparent via our smartphone and its application; or underneath the hood to power the current day LLMs such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude; it has made a great impact in the society around us.
