Week 2</A>
</H1>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Question:</SPAN> Last week, you were asked to write about priorities a CEO might have when developing an AI technology. This week, please write a paragraph (5â€“10 sentences) to reflect on your current perspective as an AI user. Consider the following prompts to get started:

<UL>
<LI>What is an example of something you do using AI?
</LI>
<LI>If you had a choice between two AI technologies that function similarly, what criteria would you use to decide between them?
</LI>
<LI>Each ethical framework was connected with a guiding principle (e.g. Hindu = duty). Which ethical framework do you think would be most helpful in shaping your perspective on AI and why?
</LI>
</UL>
<DIV class="CENTER">

</DIV>
An example of something that I do using AI, is using LLMs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet to help me look up, understand, and study topics from my courses; such as recently with my Calculus II class to study up for Tuesday's quiz. If I had a choice between two AI technologies that function similarly, the criteria that I use to decide between them is: it has to have really advanced mathematical and logical reasoning to understand my questions and the content that I present to it, it must be able to generate comprehensive and understandable images such as graphs and other graphics, and finally [most AI users would agree on this issue] it should be able to have a form of "memory bank" or "brain" that can actively recall things instead of hallucinating and giving gibberish responses. The ethical framework that I think is the most helpful in shaping my perspective on AI is the consequentialist framework as personally to me, I want to keep myself informed and understand the possible outcomes [or impacts] that AI technology could affect in the long- or short-term run, such as the case of the AI100 study. Furthermore, the consequentialist ethical framework is also helpful in delving into these ethical topics of AI in a more broader sense.
