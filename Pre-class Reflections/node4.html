<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Questions: </SPAN>Part 1:
Reflecting on the "Ethics in AI: Guidelines" video and your own personal values, write a paragraph (5–10 sentences) that highlights your thoughts about the challenges of developing AI and ethical AI guidelines in certain parts of the world when the AI technologies and the ethical guidelines will be applied globally. What stood out to you in the video? You may address the questions below or others.

<UL>
<LI>Which ethical themes would you prioritize and why?
</LI>
<LI>How well do your priorities line up with the priorities described in the video (which are also those emphasized in published AI ethics guidelines)?
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Part 2:
Reflecting on the content of this module (including all videos and reading), write a paragraph (5–10 sentences) that includes one or more of the following:

<UL>
<LI>Insightful questions;
</LI>
<LI>Clarification questions about ambiguities;
</LI>
<LI>Comments about the relation of the content to previous content;
</LI>
<LI>Solutions to problems or exercises posed in the readings or videos;
</LI>
<LI>Critiques;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on what you would like to learn about in more detail;
</LI>
<LI>Possible extensions or related studies;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on the topic's importance; and summaries of the most important things you learned.
</LI>
</UL>
Part 2 of this reflection is designed both to encourage you to engage with the videos before Thursday class and also to allow us to incorporate some of your responses into the Thursday class discussions.

A few of the ethical themes that I think myself would prioritize would be the principles of transparency and privacy; as those have been more persistent and brought to light as areas of concern per the public and average consumer. The reason behind this logic and why I chose these themes are because of the recent litigation of how OpenAI uses public data and datasets to feed information that is accessible to chatGPT and the end use of chatGPT. This is something that should be an area of regulation or determine an ethical method deal with intellectual property and how an AI company can use it. In the other hand, there has to be some form of transparency between the AI company that is using public data for its LLMs or etc, its end users who have access to this data, and to those who are within the public data set. As both transparency and privacy have become more of a concern for the end user [consumer] and the general public in the past decade. My priorities do somewhat align or even overlap with some of the priorities described in the video and the published AI ethics guidelines.

<P>
Some interesting things, as for someone who is a non-CS major, but have had 5+ years of outside experience in the field; some of the courses that I'm taking for adding CS as my major, is one class that has stuck out to me in this whole entire module: SDS 321. As most of the module covers about probability, the majority of the concepts, texts, and general theme overlaps and even some of the content is exactly the same; it makes me think that in some way as you progress through your CS undergrad, you learn little by little of AI significance in the field, even though it might be a bit more distinct.
