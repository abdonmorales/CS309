Week 1</A>

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Question:</SPAN> Reflecting on the topics from this module, write a paragraph (5–10 sentences) discussing your current perspective. Choose one of the applications of AI mentioned in this week’s course materials (e.g., autonomous vehicles, review of job applications, evaluation of job performance, assistive robots, etc.)

<P>
Imagine you are the CEO at a company developing the tool you have chosen. Reflect on some of the potential risks and benefits of this tool. As CEO, what are your top ethical priorities for your team that is developing this tool?
<DIV class="CENTER">

My perspective of the topics discussed over ethics in the development of artificial intelligence combines the idea of human interaction and the need for a safety net to ensure AI is used responsibly. As mentioned in the podcast, "What is AI, Anyway?", the goal of ethics for AI is to ensure AI does more good than harm, which ultimately depends on how we interact with these technologies. The podcast highlights, "AI is not doing anything by itself. It'll be AI technologies and it'll be people who are using AI technologies that are doing things that are either beneficial or harmful." If I were a CEO at a company developing a tool for reviewing job applications, some potential risks include the tool makes biased decisions based on the hard-coded parameters such as age, race, gender, work experience when coming into a conclusion if job applicant is acceptable or not. This can lead to unjust outcomes as seen in the case of a news-bite shown in the lecture video of a possible "racist AI" or beyond. However, some benefits of this tool is its cost-effectiveness and efficiency, where it can process large volumes of applications without the consumption of a lot of resources and money. As CEO, some ethical priorities is for my team for developing this tools is for it to be fair and non-discriminant, transparent and accountable through clear guidelines, human-centered design with proper oversight, and safety and security through fail-safe, regular audits, and monitoring of the tool.
