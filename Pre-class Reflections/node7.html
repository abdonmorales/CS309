Week 8</A>
</H1>
Part 1:
SCENARIO: You are part of a team developing an app that can predict disease outbreaks using data collected from online sources. The team decides to gather large datasets from social media, public websites, and forums to train a machine learning model that will help identify health trends. However, some of this data includes personal information, like location details or personal health stories that people may not have explicitly agreed to share for such purposes.

<P>
The app is designed to benefit society by helping predict and prevent the spread of diseases, potentially saving lives. But the data was scraped from the internet without the explicit consent of the individuals involved.

<P>
Write a paragraph reflecting on the ethical implications of deploying this app. You may address questions such as:

<UL>
<LI>What is it ethical to gather this data without permission, even though the goal is to use it for a positive cause?
</LI>
<LI>If the data is publicly available, does it justify using it without explicit consent?
</LI>
<LI>What steps could be taken to ensure that data collection respects individual privacy while still enabling beneficial uses of the information?
</LI>
<LI>What alternative methods could be used to gather the necessary dat while respecting people's privacy and consent?
</LI>
</UL>
Part 2:
Reflecting on the content of this module (including all videos and reading), write a paragraph (5â€“10 sentences) that includes one or more of the following:

<UL>
<LI>Insightful questions;
</LI>
<LI>Clarification questions about ambiguities;
</LI>
<LI>Comments about the relation of the content to previous content;
</LI>
<LI>Solutions to problems or exercises posed in the readings or videos;
</LI>
<LI>Critiques;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on what you would like to learn about in more detail;
</LI>
<LI>Possible extensions or related studies;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on the topic's importance; and
</LI>
<LI>Summaries of the most important things you learned.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
I believe the manner that this data was scrapped is completely unethical; since the user did not give consent for their data to be accessed in a way that is somewhat illegal and a violation of their right to privacy [dependent on the Terms of Service also]. I say again, that even if it is for a positive cause; I think the manner the data was accessed is not ethical or legal in some way or form. If the data is publicly available such as a government website, then yes; but the data should be cleaned for any personal or detailing information that could expose or put the user's privacy in harm; then yes, I believe this is more of an ethical approach than that detailed in the scenario. As I mentioned, one of the ways to respect people's privacy and consent could be through censoring of personal or detailing information; and if the personal information or details are needed, to reach to the individual(s). Furthermore, if the individual(s) does give their consent, then these files or data should be encrypted to protect this valuable, important, and vulnerable data. Some alternative methods that could be used ensure that data collection respects individual privacy and consent is through the public government databases; where they can request such necessary information through legal and respectful means. Another way, is to just gather fresh data via a consent form or an agreement, and so on; thus, creating another alternate way of data collection.

<P>
Somethings in this prompt are of concern in the current applications of the real world such as how cookies and other web data store our personal information; and without proper security measures can lead to catastrophic data leak/loss that have occurred in the past 5-10 years.

<P>
