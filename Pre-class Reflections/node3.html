<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Questions: </SPAN>Part 1:
Reflecting on the clips from Robot and Frank and your personal values, write a paragraph (5–10 sentences) discussing your current perspective on the following ethical theme. 
If you had a loved one in need of extra care and an assistive AI tool were available, would you use it? Reflect on requirements/expectations you would have for the tool, and some of the risks and benefits of using an AI tool for healthcare support. Dr. Fleischman suggested that a computing code of ethics might be introduced in the future. What is one principle that, if outlined in a computing code of ethics, would make you feel better about using AI for eldercare?

<P>
Part 2:
Reflecting on the content of this module (including videos and reading), write a paragraph (5–10 sentences) that includes one or more of the following:

<UL>
<LI>Insightful questions;
</LI>
<LI>Clarification questions about ambiguities;
</LI>
<LI>Comments about the relation of the content to previous content;
</LI>
<LI>Solutions to problems or exercises posed in the readings or videos;
</LI>
<LI>Critiques;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on what you would like to learn about in more detail;
</LI>
<LI>Possible extensions or related studies;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on the topic's importance; and summaries of the most important things you learned.
</LI>
</UL>
Part 2 of this reflection is designed both to encourage you to engage with the videos before Thursday class and also to allow us to incorporate some of your responses into the Thursday class discussions.

Based on my current perspective of both the film and the current issues with care in retirement homes (and extra care home for older adults), I would in any scenario let an assistive AI take extra care of a loved one. However, there should be some form of ethical standards for AI when introduced in a much high-risk area such as healthcare support and similar. A few requirements for AI to be part of a loved one's healthcare or healthcare support is having the intelligence of that of a human, the ability to have some sort of physical form to assist with physical chores or obstacles, and a form of ethics that it itself can interpret what is right and wrong.
One principle that if outlined in a computing code of ethics would make me feel better using AI for for healthcare is it duties for it's owner/client/consumer as being the superior directive over all directives as it's the utmost importance for it to help take care of its caretaker/elder.
