<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Questions: </SPAN>
Part 1:
SCENARIO: You are a serving as a city council member in a city that has seen a recent uptick in crime. The city is considering implementing an advanced AI-powered video surveillance system in some public spaces (e.g., parks, streets, and transportation hubs) with the goals of increasing public safety and responding quickly to emergencies. The AI system can recognize faces, detect suspicious behaviors, and track individuals across multiple cameras. 

<P>
At a city council meeting, community members express concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse. One resident argues that constant surveillance would make them feel like they are always being watched, and is a violation of their personal freedom. Another expresses concerns that the AI might misidentify individuals, particularly people from marginalized groups, leading to false accusations or discrimination. A third individual is worried the collected data could be hacked or used for purposes beyond preserving well-being, such as for advertising or personal tracking by private companies.

<P>
Write a paragraph addressing the ethics of such a surveillance system. You may address the questions below or others.

<UL>
<LI>What balance should be struck between public safety and individual privacy?
</LI>
<LI>How should concerns about privacy and data security be addressed?
</LI>
<LI>What safeguards could be put in place to prevent misuse or discrimination by the AI system?
</LI>
</UL>
Part 2:
Reflecting on the content of this module (including all videos and reading), write a paragraph (5â€“10 sentences) that includes one or more of the following:

<UL>
<LI>Insightful questions;
</LI>
<LI>Clarification questions about ambiguities;
</LI>
<LI>Comments about the relation of the content to previous content;
</LI>
<LI>Solutions to problems or exercises posed in the readings or videos;
</LI>
<LI>Critiques;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on what you would like to learn about in more detail;
</LI>
<LI>Possible extensions or related studies;
</LI>
<LI>Thoughts on the topic's importance; and summaries of the most important things you learned.
</LI>
</UL>
Part 2 of this reflection is designed both to encourage you to engage with the videos before Thursday class and also to allow us to incorporate some of your responses into the Thursday class discussions.

On the question of "What balance should be struck between public safety and individual privacy?", our implementation of this AI-powered surveillance system to address the concerns of privacy is to keep all the data stored in house in the costs of maintaining our own infrastructure; as we understand the concerns of the citizens' right to privacy. Furthermore, the purpose of this surveillance system has no ill-intentions as its main purpose is to maintain public safety. To also address the concerns of data security and integrity, most of this data will be stored at secure locations, as a distributed storage system to maintain the outmost data integrity. Furthermore, with the data being onsite, we also would like to protect it from attacks both within and outside the network, thus for department individuals who want to access the system must have a security key or access the system within the network. The concerns of a biased AI is something that should be addressed; to be direct, this is something that we could try and mitigate, but since our dataset contains everyone general ID/profile, this is something that we can't really control. Therefore, we will also have a human supervisor to have some control and mitigate the discriminational bias of our AI-powered surveillance system. In addition to address the concern of misuse, we will implement form of a security clearance system as a way to also mitigate the possibility of misuse.

<P>
My thoughts of this module of Computer Vision are interesting, because of how it applies in our day-to-day such as the OCR technology for analyzing text such as PDFs and images. In addition, AI, computer vision, and LLMs have become powerful for reading documents and images to then store that data for it to respond to the end user. These advances in the field of computer vision could become the "Next Big Thing" that could effect the industries like healthcare, game development, and LLMs such as GE Healthcare, Treyarch, Microsoft, OpenAI, and etc.
